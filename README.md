## What is it?
It is an attempt to extract images  with their description from old arabic magazines. This problem poses a difficulty in unlocking the full potential of documets that may have very important information. This information is lost due to the large number of resources being nearly impossible to manually extract or remember.

But, That is not all what we are thinking of. After solving the aforementioned main problem, we aim to train different models(or use pretrained ones) to extract infromation from different kinds of documents. Then similar documents will be clustered in order for the model to be choosen automatically according to the document type.
